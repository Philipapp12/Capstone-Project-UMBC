# Leveraging NLP Predictive Models for Suicide Prevention

# Project Overview

This project aims to develop NLP-based predictive models to identify high-risk individuals in online mental health communities, with the goal of contributing to early intervention efforts in suicide prevention. By analyzing linguistic patterns and content in posts from mental health-related subreddits, we aim to build models that can accurately identify individuals expressing suicidal ideation or emotional distress.

# Project Description
The project focuses on predicting suicide risk levels using NLP techniques on text data from Reddit posts. By analyzing linguistic patterns and content in these posts, we aim to develop models that can accurately identify individuals expressing suicidal ideation or emotional distress.

# Dataset
The dataset consists of posts from the following subreddits:
Mental health-related subreddits: r/SuicideWatch, r/depression, r/mentalhealth
Neutral/positive subreddits: r/AskReddit, r/movies, r/happy


The dataset includes features such as:

Post text content

Creation timestamp

Engagement metrics (upvotes, comments)

Sentiment scores

Risk level labels (High, Medium, Low)

The cleaned dataset is saved as Cleaned_SuicideWatch_Dataset.csv


# Methodology

# Data Preprocessing

Text Cleaning: Lowercasing, URL removal, punctuation removal, and digit removal.

Label Encoding: Converting text labels (High, Medium, Low) to numeric values.

Feature Engineering: Extracting temporal features (hour, day_of_week) from timestamps.

# NLP with Imbalanced Data
In natural language processing (NLP) tasks involving imbalanced data, relying solely on accuracy can be misleading. Although accuracy measures overall correctness, it fails to reflect the model’s ability to detect the minority class — the class we usually care most about in sensitive applications like suicide prevention. A model might achieve high accuracy by predominantly predicting the majority class, but this would be ineffective and even dangerous when the minority class contains critical cases.

Instead, precision becomes essential, as it indicates how many of the model’s positive predictions (e.g., identifying high-risk individuals) are actually correct. High precision means fewer false alarms, making the model's alerts more meaningful and trustworthy. On the other hand, recall measures the proportion of actual positive cases the model successfully identifies. In high-stakes contexts like mental health or emergency response, recall is arguably the most critical metric — missing a true high-risk case could have fatal consequences.

The F1 score, which combines precision and recall into a single metric, serves as a balanced measure when both under-alerting and over-alerting must be minimized. It is particularly valuable when there’s a need to maintain sensitivity without triggering an overwhelming number of false positives. Overall, in imbalanced NLP datasets, precision, recall, and F1 score provide a much clearer picture of a model's real-world effectiveness than accuracy alone.


# Insights and Implications

# Key Findings

Model Performance: Ensemble models and certain deep learning architectures (like CNNs) show promising results in identifying high-risk individuals.

Feature Importance: Linguistic features and temporal patterns play a significant role in predicting risk levels.

Sentiment Analysis: Sentiment scores are strongly correlated with risk levels, indicating the importance of emotional tone in posts.


# Practical Implications


Early Intervention: The models can be integrated into mental health platforms to flag high-risk users for immediate attention.

Resource Allocation: Helps mental health professionals prioritize their efforts by identifying individuals most in need.

Community Moderation: Assists moderators in identifying and supporting users in distress within online communities.


# Future Work

Model Deployment: Developing an API to deploy the best-performing models for real-time risk assessment.

User Feedback Loop: Incorporating feedback from mental health professionals to refine model predictions.

Multimodal Analysis: Exploring the integration of text, image, and audio data for a more comprehensive risk assessment.

Ethical Considerations: Developing guidelines for ethical use of predictive models in mental health contexts.
