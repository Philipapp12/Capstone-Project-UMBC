# Leveraging NLP Predictive Models for Suicide Prevention

# Project Overview

This project aims to develop NLP-based predictive models to identify high-risk individuals in online mental health communities, with the goal of contributing to early intervention efforts in suicide prevention. By analyzing linguistic patterns and content in posts from mental health-related subreddits, we aim to build models that can accurately identify individuals expressing suicidal ideation or emotional distress.
