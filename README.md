# Leveraging NLP Predictive Models for Suicide Prevention

# Project Overview

This project aims to develop NLP-based predictive models to identify high-risk individuals in online mental health communities, with the goal of contributing to early intervention efforts in suicide prevention. By analyzing linguistic patterns and content in posts from mental health-related subreddits, we aim to build models that can accurately identify individuals expressing suicidal ideation or emotional distress.

# Project Description
The project focuses on predicting suicide risk levels using NLP techniques on text data from Reddit posts. By analyzing linguistic patterns and content in these posts, we aim to develop models that can accurately identify individuals expressing suicidal ideation or emotional distress.

# Dataset
The dataset consists of posts from the following subreddits:
Mental health-related subreddits: r/SuicideWatch, r/depression, r/mentalhealth
Neutral/positive subreddits: r/AskReddit, r/movies, r/happy


The dataset includes features such as:

Post text content

Creation timestamp

Engagement metrics (upvotes, comments)

Sentiment scores

Risk level labels (High, Medium, Low)

The cleaned dataset is saved as Cleaned_SuicideWatch_Dataset.csv.
